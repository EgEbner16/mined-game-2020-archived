- The goal of the game is to make as much Capital as possible.
- You get Capital by processing Material. Both  the Mining Core and Matter Reactors can process Material.
- You need Energy and Coolant to run your mining operation. Generator make Energy and Pumps make Coolant
- If you run low on Energy your whole mine will slow down. Coolant is required for digging and a lack will cause digging to slow down.
- Distributors help make the use of energy and coolant more efficient. Build them clost to your mining operation.
- Collectors shorten the distance to drop off Material for Logistic Drones.
- Scanners are not used in the game yet.
- Make sure to build at least 1 of each drone type to start.
- Gem value order is Red, Blue, Green and Yellow (Red being lowest and Yellow behing Highest)
- The harder the gem the more coolant it requires be carful when giving mining orders.
- Watch your resources and make smart descisions on how to spend your Capital.
- Research upgrades that match you overall mine needs and make sure to balance against equipment.
